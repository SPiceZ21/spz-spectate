-- and the running order with real time gaps. Racers are excluded — they already
-- carry the full tower in spz-raceUI and a second one would cover the road.

-- Lives here rather than in its own resource because it has the same audience
-- as spectating and reuses this resource's flags, fonts and theme bridge.
