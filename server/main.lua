-- Spectator system, usable by every player. To see a player who is inside an
-- isolated race routing bucket we transiently move the spectator into that
-- bucket (native SetPlayerRoutingBucket, snapshot + restore — we deliberately
-- do NOT touch spz-core's bucket registry, since this is a temporary view, not
-- a real session move). Player data for the overlay comes from statebags, which
-- replicate globally, so the card fills in even before the bucket move lands.
